# Duplicacy GUI Proposal

This is a simple HTML mock-up of what I am looking for in a GUI version of backup software.
It is important that I can restore files in as few as clicks as possible, while also still being able to see if there are any problems with my backups in a glance.
I would like to have both a "system/gui" level log while at the same time have a log of the backup jobs that are running.
Some of the views still need to be design, but this is what I see as the big picture views that are needed.
